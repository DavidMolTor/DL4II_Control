# MIDI Controller for Line6 DL4 MkII

This is an attemp to make the DL4 MkII a little bit more usable while playing.

With the unit on a pedalboard, it is a pain to try selecting delays, selecting reverbs is just completely impossible... Until soon!

## Introduction

This projects aims to deliver all the selection system of the DL4 MkII from any computer. This application follows the available MIDI commands shown in the [DL4 MkII Manual](https://line6.com/data/6/0a020a3f177ca62c4820b92c4e/application/pdf/DL4%20MkII%20Owner's%20Manual%20-%20English%20.pdf).

The application splits the delay and reverb selection systems allowing you to select each one without needing to navigate between complex menus.
